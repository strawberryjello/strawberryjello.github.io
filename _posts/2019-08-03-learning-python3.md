Years ago I started learning Python, though I don't remember why -- it just seemed like a good idea at the time, like learning emacs. (And it was. Learning emacs, that is.) I got sidetracked when I started learning Ruby and got hired as a Rails developer instead, but now I've circled back to Python. This time I have a couple reasons why:

* The tools I use (or want to use) are written wholly or partly in Python, like [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) and [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/), and someday I'd like to contribute

* Python's tools for scraping, data mining, and science-related computing in general are more mature than Ruby's, and Ruby's offerings might never catch up (though that could change)

After finding a post about [switching from Ruby to Python](https://blog.sqreen.com/from-ruby-to-python/) I decided to try out the [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans); I've also started going over Real Python's [intro to Python 3 series](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python3-introduction/). I'm not giving up Ruby -- I love using it, especially for little command-line tools -- but it'd be nice to try a different language for a change.
